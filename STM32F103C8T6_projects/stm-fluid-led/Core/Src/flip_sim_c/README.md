# FLIP Fluid Simulation Core

Platform-agnostic fluid simulation library for STM32.

## Files

- `flip_fluid.c/h` - Core FLIP fluid simulation engine
- `flip_utils.c/h` - Scene setup utilities
- `scene.c/h` - Scene structure and initialization

## Usage

This library is integrated into the STM32 project. The simulation reads accelerometer data and displays the fluid on an 8x8 LED matrix.
